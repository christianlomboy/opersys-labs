REVISIONS:


*Added parser test*

This folder contains code for testing the parser function. Inside the code, the user is able 
to input a string and specify a delimiter to tokenize the string with. The parsed string is 
then printed. Screenshots of testing have also been provided.


*Fixed segmentation fault when running on Ubuntu OS*

During my demo, the program would crash whenever I tried running an external command. This 
issue has been fixed. Provided are screenshots of external command testing. The actual code 
revisions are inside the 'myshell_fixed' source code folder. The problem occurred because I 
was calling fclose() twice inside of the 'findPath' function.
